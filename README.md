# Projectbikesharing
About the Project:  Using bike sharing system people are able to rent a bike from one location and return it to different  place on an as-needed basis. Bike sharing systems function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility  in a city.
About Data - 
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, 
rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. 
Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.
The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of 
travel, departure location, arrivallocation, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded.
